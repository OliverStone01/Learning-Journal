# 📚 Learning Journal

Welcome to my learning Journal! I use this to track my learning progress, maintain consistency in my learning habits, and create targets for what I want to learn next!

🗓️ Check-ins are organised by month and contain what i'm done today, tomorrow's targets, and projects i'm working on.
