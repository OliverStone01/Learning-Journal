# 📚 Learning Journal and Notes

Welcome to my learning Journal! I use this to track my learning progress, write  check-ins, and organise my notes.

### 🗓️ Journal
Check-ins are organised by month and contain what i'm currently learning and working on.

### 📝 Notes by topic
Notes are organised by topic and language. Each note includes sources, exercises, and personal takeaways.

-----
This helps me maintain consistency in my learning habits and keep up-to-date notes for reference.
