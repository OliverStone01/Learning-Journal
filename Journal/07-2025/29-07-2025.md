  -  Listened to 2 hours of security+


### 🎯 Goals for tomorrow.
- Complete CS50 Cyber security. (big goal)
- Super study for security+ exam
- Write up try hack me rooms.

- Im changing my approach now that CS50 cyber is almost done. I want to pass the security+ exam in this month or the next so im putting my `100 days of swift` into limp mode which means doing an hour to two hours a day instead of working until it's complete. I want to focus all my energy into studying for the exam.
