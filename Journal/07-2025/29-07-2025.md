- Listen to 2 hours of security+.

- 💬 I'm changing my approach now that CS50 cyber is almost done. I want to pass the security+ exam as my next goal so im putting my `100 days of swift` into "limp" mode which means doing an hour to two hours a day instead of working until it's complete. I want to focus all my energy into studying for the exam.
